This directory contains all the parameters for the atomtypes used in the
simulations (K+, Cl-, I-, SCN-, BCETB and SPC/E water).

In the bottom of ffnonbonded.itp, the explicit cross-interactions between the atoms in SCN-
and K+, and SCN- and water,  are given, in order to match the cross-interactions in the original
paper where the SCN- force field was derived, using a different combination
rule (Lorentz-Berthelot instead of geometric which was used here).
