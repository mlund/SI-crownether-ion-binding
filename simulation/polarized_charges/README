Here, the indices, atom types, and partial charges on BCETB according to the
polarized DFT force field are given (the partial charges are the only
parameters that differ from the OPLS-AA and DFT force fields, but the whole
block of parameters is provided so that it can be used directly in a topology
file). There are three complexes, with different charges: the empty BCETB, the
complex with one K+ bound, and the complex with 2 K+ bound, and the files are
named accordingly.
