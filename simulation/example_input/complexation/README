This is an example directory used for simulation of KCl and BCETB in SPC/E
water, and the process of complexing the FIRST K+ (from a vacuum to the
binding site in BCETB). This corresponds to the complexation free energy of
the first ion.  

In solvated/solvated.top, the creation of an ion pair (K+ and Cl-) is
specified. Also, all the intra- and intermolecular interaction parameters on
BCETB are given.

In the MDP directory, the input files for all temperatures used the in replica
exchange scheme and all lambdas later used in the free energy calculation are
located. For example, MDP/NPT/310K/npt_16.mdp gives the input variables for
the pressure equilibration at 310K using parameters on K+ and Cl- according to
the lambda with index 16.   

min.sh, nvt.sh, npt.sh, and prod.sh are the scripts for running the
energy minimization, temperature equilibration, pressure equilibration, and
production run, respectively. 

aurora.sh provides an example of a slurm script for simulating at a computer
cluster, and submit.sh is used for submitting several slurm jobs in sequence,
from lambda_0 to lambda_32, covering the whole creation of the ion pair.
